### Event Handlers[¶](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html#event-handlers)

It can be used in similar XSS attacks to the one above (this is the most comprehensive list on the net, at the time of this writing). Thanks to Rene Ledosquet for the HTML+TIME updates.

The [Dottoro Web Reference](http://help.dottoro.com/) also has a nice [list of events in JavaScript](http://help.dottoro.com/ljfvvdnm.php).

1. `FSCommand()` (attacker can use this when executed from within an embedded Flash object)
2. `onAbort()` (when user aborts the loading of an image)
3. `onActivate()` (when object is set as the active element)
4. `onAfterPrint()` (activates after user prints or previews print job)
5. `onAfterUpdate()` (activates on data object after updating data in the source object)
6. `onBeforeActivate()` (fires before the object is set as the active element)
7. `onBeforeCopy()` (attacker executes the attack string right before a selection is copied to the clipboard - attackers can do this with the `execCommand("Copy")` function)
8. `onBeforeCut()` (attacker executes the attack string right before a selection is cut)
9. `onBeforeDeactivate()` (fires right after the activeElement is changed from the current object)
10. `onBeforeEditFocus()` (Fires before an object contained in an editable element enters a UI-activated state or when an editable container object is control selected)
11. `onBeforePaste()` (user needs to be tricked into pasting or be forced into it using the `execCommand("Paste")` function)
12. `onBeforePrint()` (user would need to be tricked into printing or attacker could use the `print()` or `execCommand("Print")` function).
13. `onBeforeUnload()` (user would need to be tricked into closing the browser - attacker cannot unload windows unless it was spawned from the parent)
14. `onBeforeUpdate()` (activates on data object before updating data in the source object)
